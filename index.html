                Rivers are essential to both the environment and human society,
                serving as sources of
                <span class="blue">drinking water, irrigation, and industrial processes, as well as
                    supporting diverse ecosystems</span>. This project presents a comprehensive comparison of the Ganga
                River
                in India and the Thames River in the UK. It examines their current
                pollution levels and those from a decade ago, focusing on
                <span class="red">pesticides, heavy metals, organic waste, chemical waste, and direct
                    sewage discharge.</span>
                We also evaluate the water quality, potability, and impact on aquatic
                life. Additionally, we explore
                <span class="green">the actions taken by individuals, communities, and governments to
                    improve these rivers' conditions.</span>

                <figcaption>Rivers, vital to ecosystems and human life, face significant threats from pollution and
                    environmental degradation. Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or
                    microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading
                    water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment.</figcaption>

                <h5>Pesticides</h5>
                <p>
                    The Ganga River faces severe pesticide pollution primarily due to
                    agricultural runoff. Pesticides such as DDT, HCH, and other
                    organochlorines are commonly used in the agricultural fields
                    surrounding the river basin. <span class="bold"> Studies have shown that concentrations
                        of DDT can reach up to 1.2 µg/L, while HCH levels are around 0.9
                        µg/L in certain stretches of the river.</span> <span class="red">These persistent organic
                        pollutants (POPs) are resistant to environmental degradation,
                        leading to bioaccumulation in the food chain. This poses significant
                        health risks to humans and aquatic life, including hormonal
                        disruptions and increased cancer risk.</span>

                    <figcaption>Pesticides can enter the river's bottom sediments and become a consistent source of
                        aquatic pollution. They can also be dangerous to human health, and some studies have found that
                        concentrations of pesticides in the river exceed international safety standards.

                <h5>Heavy Metals</h5>
                <p>
                    Heavy metal contamination is a critical issue for the Ganga River.
                    Industrial activities, mining operations, and agricultural runoff
                    contribute to high levels of arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium in
                    the river water. <span class="bold">Arsenic levels range from 0.05 to 0.1 mg/L,
                        significantly higher than the World Health Organization’s (WHO) safe
                        limit of 0.01 mg/L for drinking water. Lead concentrations vary
                        between 0.02 and 0.05 mg/L.</span> <span class="red">These heavy metals can cause severe
                        health problems, including neurological damage, kidney failure, and
                        developmental issues in children. The contamination also affects the
                        river’s biodiversity, reducing fish populations and impacting
                        aquatic plants.</span>
                </p>

                    <figcaption>For many, Ganga remains the potion of faith, with its endless life-giving waters. Scores
                        of devotees perform their ceremonial ablutions at a ghat on the Ganges River after sunrise. A
                        recent report points to the presence of heavy metals in Varanasi Ganga, which reportedly is
                        putting human health at risk. It poses a severe risk to aquatic life, too.The concentration of
                        studied heavy metals was found to exceed permissible limits set by international standards.

                <h5>Organic Waste</h5>
                <p>
                    Organic waste pollution in the Ganga is predominantly due to the
                    discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage and the disposal
                    of waste from religious activities. <span class="bold">The Biochemical Oxygen Demand
                        (BOD) levels, which indicate the amount of organic matter in water,
                        are alarmingly high, often exceeding 5 mg/L in many areas. High BOD
                        levels deplete dissolved oxygen in the water, making it difficult
                        for aquatic organisms to survive.</span> This organic pollution is
                    exacerbated during festivals when large quantities of biodegradable
                    materials, flowers, and ashes are thrown into the river.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h5>Chemical Waste</h5>
                <p>
                    Industrial effluents are a major source of chemical waste in the
                    Ganga. Tanneries, paper mills, textile factories, and other
                    industries discharge untreated or inadequately treated wastewater
                    containing hazardous chemicals, dyes, and solvents into the river.
                    <span class="red">The presence of these chemicals leads to water toxicity, affecting
                        both human health and the ecosystem. For instance, chromium from
                        tanneries can cause severe skin conditions and respiratory problems,
                        while other chemicals may disrupt endocrine systems in aquatic
                        organisms.</span>

                        Haridwar to Ganga Sagar. According to the data of Central
                        Pollution Control Board (CPCB), more than 6000 litres of waste water is being drained into the
                        river. Of the 350 rivers in the country, around 70 polluted river stretches are in West Bengal.

                <h5>Direct Sewage Discharge</h5>
                <p>
                    Direct sewage discharge remains a significant problem for the Ganga
                    River. Despite efforts to increase sewage treatment capacity,
                    approximately 2.9 billion liters of untreated sewage are still
                    discharged into the river daily. This untreated sewage contains not
                    only organic waste but also pathogens, heavy metals, and nutrients
                    that lead to eutrophication. <span class="bold">The proliferation of harmful algal
                        blooms from nutrient overload further depletes oxygen levels,
                        creating dead zones where aquatic life cannot survive. This
                        contamination severely affects the river’s potability and poses
                        serious health risks to communities relying on the river for their
                        daily water needs.</span>

                <p>
                    The cumulative effect of these pollutants is a substantial decline
                    in water quality, rendering it unsafe for drinking and detrimental
                    to aquatic life. The river’s ecosystem has been severely impacted,
                    with many fish species facing extinction due to the toxic
                    environment. The biodiversity of the Ganga has decreased, and the
                    health of surviving aquatic species is compromised, affecting the
                    entire food web.

                <h5>Pesticides</h5>
                <p>
                    A decade ago, pesticide pollution in the Ganga was present but less
                    severe compared to today. The levels of DDT and HCH were lower,
                    reflecting somewhat less intensive agricultural practices. However,
                    the awareness and regulation of pesticide use were not as robust,
                    leading to a gradual increase in contamination over the years.

                <p>
                    Heavy metal contamination was also significant a decade ago.
                    Industrial regulations were not as stringent, leading to higher
                    emissions of arsenic, lead, and mercury into the river. Monitoring
                    and remediation efforts were limited, contributing to the
                    accumulation of these metals in the river ecosystem.

                <p>
                    Organic waste pollution was consistently high, driven by inadequate
                    waste management infrastructure. The BOD levels were similar to
                    current figures, reflecting the persistent challenge of untreated
                    sewage and waste from religious activities. Efforts to improve waste
                    management were in their early stages, leading to limited progress.

                <p>
                    Industrial pollution was prevalent, with many industries discharging
                    untreated effluents into the river. Regulatory frameworks were less
                    effective, and enforcement was weak, allowing for significant
                    chemical waste to enter the Ganga. The impact on water quality and
                    aquatic life was severe, contributing to the river's declining
                    health.

                <p>
                    Untreated sewage discharge was widespread, with limited sewage
                    treatment facilities available. The infrastructure for sewage
                    management was underdeveloped, leading to significant volumes of
                    untreated sewage entering the river. This contributed to high levels
                    of pathogens and organic pollutants in the water.

                    The water quality of the Ganga a decade ago was poor, with high
                    levels of contaminants affecting its potability and safety. The
                    aquatic life in the river was already in decline, with many species
                    struggling to survive in the polluted environment. The biodiversity
                    of the river was decreasing, reflecting the severe impact of

                <h5>Government Initiatives</h5>
                <p>
                    To address the severe pollution of the Ganga, the Indian government
                    launched several initiatives. The most notable is the Namami Gange
                    Programme, initiated in 2015. This comprehensive program aims to
                    clean and rejuvenate the river through various measures, including
                    improving sewage treatment infrastructure, regulating industrial
                    effluents, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. The
                    program has led to the establishment and upgrading of numerous
                    sewage treatment plants (STPs) in major cities along the Ganga,
                    enhancing their capacity and operational efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The government has also implemented stricter regulations on
                    industrial discharges. Industries are required to treat their
                    effluents to meet specified standards before discharge. Regular
                    monitoring and stringent penalties for non-compliance are enforced
                    to ensure adherence to these regulations. Additionally, there have
                    been efforts to promote eco-friendly practices in agriculture, such
                    as integrated pest management and the use of organic fertilizers, to
                    reduce pesticide runoff.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h5>Community and Individual Actions</h5>
                <p>
                    At the community level, various NGOs and local groups have been
                    actively involved in awareness campaigns and river-cleaning
                    activities. These initiatives aim to educate the public about the
                    importance of the river and the impact of pollution.
                    Community-driven clean-up drives are regularly organized, engaging
                    local residents, students, and volunteers in efforts to remove waste
                    and debris from the riverbanks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Individuals have also played a role by participating in clean-up
                    drives and reducing their plastic usage. Public awareness programs
                    have encouraged people to adopt eco-friendly practices in their
                    daily lives, such as minimizing the use of single-use plastics and
                    properly disposing of waste. Religious leaders and organizations
                    have been involved
                </p>
                <p>
                    Religious leaders and organizations have been involved in promoting
                    environmentally friendly practices during festivals and religious
                    ceremonies. They encourage devotees to use biodegradable materials
                    and avoid immersing non-biodegradable items in the river. This
                    collaborative effort has helped reduce the pollution load during
                    major religious events.

                <h5>Pesticides</h5>
                <p>
                    The Thames River in the UK also faces challenges with pesticide
                    pollution, although to a lesser extent compared to the Ganga.
                    Agricultural runoff is the primary source, with pesticides like
                    neonicotinoids and glyphosate being detected in the water. These
                    chemicals can harm aquatic insects and other wildlife, but
                    regulatory measures have helped to keep their concentrations below
                    hazardous levels for human health.

                <h5>Heavy Metals</h5>
                <p>
                    Heavy metal contamination in the Thames arises from historical
                    industrial activities and urban runoff. Metals such as cadmium,
                    lead, and mercury are found in sediment and water samples. While
                    current levels are generally within safe limits for human health,
                    they can still pose risks to aquatic life, particularly benthic
                    organisms that live in or near the riverbed.

                <h5>Organic Waste</h5>
                <p>
                    Organic waste pollution in the Thames has been significantly reduced
                    through effective wastewater treatment and strict regulations.
                    However, occasional combined sewer overflows (CSOs) during heavy
                    rainfall can lead to temporary spikes in organic matter, affecting
                    water quality and dissolved oxygen levels.

                <h5>Chemical Waste</h5>
                <p>
                    Chemical waste from industrial and urban sources remains a concern
                    for the Thames. Efforts to control and treat industrial discharges
                    have been successful, but emerging pollutants like pharmaceuticals
                    and personal care products are increasingly detected in the water.
                    These substances can disrupt endocrine systems in aquatic life and
                    accumulate in the food chain.

                <h5>Direct Sewage Discharge</h5>
                <p>
                    Direct sewage discharge into the Thames is rare due to the
                    comprehensive sewage treatment infrastructure. However, incidents of
                    untreated sewage entering the river still occur during extreme
                    weather events. These incidents are closely monitored and addressed
                    to minimize their impact on water quality and public health.

                <h5>Water Quality and Aquatic Life</h5>
                <p>
                    The water quality of the Thames has improved significantly over the
                    past few decades. It is now considered one of the cleanest
                    metropolitan rivers in the world. The recovery of the river has led
                    to a resurgence in biodiversity, with species such as salmon,
                    otters, and various bird species returning to the river. Continuous
                    monitoring and management efforts ensure that the Thames remains a
                    healthy and vibrant ecosystem.

            <article>
                <h5>Pesticides</h5>
                <p>
                    A decade ago, the Thames experienced higher levels of pesticide
                    pollution due to less stringent agricultural practices. Efforts to
                    regulate and reduce pesticide usage have since improved water
                    quality, benefiting both human health and the river's ecosystem.

            <article>
                <h5>Heavy Metals</h5>
                <p>
                    Heavy metal contamination was more pronounced ten years ago. Since
                    then, remediation efforts and stricter regulations have reduced the
                    levels of these contaminants, although legacy pollution from
                    historical industrial activities remains a challenge.

                <h5>Organic Waste</h5>
                <p>
                    Organic waste pollution has been a long-standing issue for the
                    Thames. A decade ago, CSOs were more frequent, leading to higher BOD
                    levels and lower dissolved oxygen concentrations. Investments in
                    upgrading wastewater infrastructure have since mitigated these
                    problems, resulting in improved water quality.

                <h5>Chemical Waste</h5>
                <p>
                    Industrial and urban chemical waste contributed significantly to
                    pollution in the Thames a decade ago. Ongoing efforts to regulate
                    discharges and treat wastewater have reduced the presence of harmful
                    chemicals, although emerging pollutants continue to pose new
                    challenges.

                <p>
                    The water quality of the Thames was poorer a decade ago, with higher
                    levels of contaminants affecting aquatic life. Restoration efforts
                    have since led to a dramatic improvement in biodiversity and overall
                    river health, showcasing the success of targeted environmental
                    management.

            <h4  class="divider gradientGreen">Actions Taken</h4>
            <article>
                <h5>Government Initiatives</h5>
                <p>
                    The UK government has implemented several measures to protect and
                    restore the Thames. The establishment of the Thames Tideway Tunnel
                    project, a significant infrastructure investment, aims to reduce
                    CSOs and improve water quality. This “super sewer” will intercept
                    and store excess sewage and rainwater during heavy rainfall,
                    preventing untreated sewage from entering the river.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Environmental regulations, such as the Water Framework Directive,
                    have also been instrumental in improving the river’s health. These
                    regulations set targets for water quality and biodiversity, with
                    regular monitoring and reporting to ensure compliance. The
                    government works closely with environmental agencies, local
                    authorities, and stakeholders to achieve these goals.
                </p>

                <h5>Community and Individual Actions</h5>
                <p>
                    Community involvement has been a cornerstone of efforts to protect
                    the Thames. Organizations such as the Thames21 charity engage
                    volunteers in river clean-up activities, habitat restoration, and
                    educational programs. These initiatives raise awareness and foster a
                    sense of stewardship among local communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Individuals contribute by participating in clean-up events, reducing
                    plastic use, and supporting policies aimed at environmental
                    protection. Public campaigns highlight the importance of keeping the
                    river clean and the role that every individual can play in
                    preserving this vital natural resource.
